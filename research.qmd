My research spans various areas of theoretical computer science.

In **cryptography**, I currently focus on both foundations and the design of efficient **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**.

In **computational complexity**, I am particularly interested in understanding total NP search problems (**TFNP**).

A significant part of my work explores the bridge between **game theory** and cryptography, designing and analysing protocols that are secure in the presence of rational utility-maximizing agents.
