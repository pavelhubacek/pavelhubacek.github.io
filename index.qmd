I am a **cryptographer**.

My research explores the theoretical foundations of security, focusing on the intersections of **cryptography**, **computational complexity**, and **game theory**.

Currently, I am jointly affiliated with the [Institute of Mathematics of the Czech Academy of Sciences](https://www.math.cas.cz/index.php/department/detail/16) and the [Computer Science Institute of Charles University](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en/iuuk).

I got my PhD in computer science from **Aarhus University** after finishing my undergraduate studies in mathematics at **Charles University**. Before returning to Prague, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the **Weizmann Institute of Science** and **Reichman University** (IDC Herzliya).
